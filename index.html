      <p id="para"> After the struggle of almost two hundred years, on the dawn of this day exactly 75 years ago, India was freed from the shackles of foreign rule. The declaration of freedom was probably the happiest thing that could have happened to India. <p id="pa2"> In the span of those two hundred years before 1947, Indians had to suffer from endless pains that were caused by the Britishers. British rulers did racial discrimination, political and social, oppression, execution of crowds that rebelled, and many more such evils. After much struggle, sacrifices, and continuous hardships, our freedom fighters were able to overthrow the faulty ruling system of Britishers.<p id="pa1">On the occasion of Independence Day, several events that are organized are done to express and rekindle the spirit of patriotism and brotherhood among Indians. Flag hoisting and parade were done by the military are commonly noticed all over the country on 15th August of every year.
    <p id="p3">  Let us pay our respects to all those martyrs who brought freedom to India. </p><p id="pa"> !!Jai Hind Jai Bharat!! </p> <br>
